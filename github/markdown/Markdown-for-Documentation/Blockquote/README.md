# Blockquotes using MD
```
Blockquoting a paragraph requires adding '>' symbol before a paragraph

Example: 
> My first blockquote paragraph
```
> My first blockquote paragraph

## Blockquoting multiple paragraphs together.
```
Leave a blank line with > only to connect blockquoted paragraphs.

> ...P1...
>
> ...P2...
