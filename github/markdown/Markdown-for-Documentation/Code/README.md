# Code in Markdown
```
Code use <code> tag of html and replace it with ``
```

# Single tick Codes 
```
One great use of single tick code `` is used to insert HTML tag as a theory content.
Because, MD is compatible with html, writing <html> won't render on md file directly.

`<html>`
```
`<html>`

## Escaping Single Tick codes
```
If we want to use `` in the code block itself, use `` `` to escape it.
```
`` Hello `code` Blocks ``

## Language codes
```
Use the triple ticks followed by language name to render keywords as an IDE would do. 
```

```python
print(abs(3+4j));
```

```html
<body>
	<p> Hello World
	</p>
</body>
```
